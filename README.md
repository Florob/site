XSF Static Site
===============

The new XSF Site (blog, and other bits) will be statically generated \o/



Tools
-----
The site generator uses the Python project Pelican, and as such, requires a python environment to use.

* Python 2.6 or 2.7
* pelican 3.1 
* jinja2 2.6
* typogrify 2.0
* markdown 2.2

The source markdown files are found in the content/ directory and it's layout is not set in stone - I expect to make many tweaks as needed.
