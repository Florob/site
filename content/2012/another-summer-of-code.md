We're happy to announce that the XSF has been accepted to participate in the Google Summer of Code for 2012. See our [wiki page](http://wiki.xmpp.org/web/Summer_of_Code_2012) for details. We still have time to add project ideas to the list there, so if you participate in an XMPP-related codebase feel free to get involved!
