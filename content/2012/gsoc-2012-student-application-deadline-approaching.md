![](http://code.google.com/images/GSoC2012_300x200.png)It's great to see this many applications for GSoC projects so far, but there are still a few days left to apply. So if you're a student and interested in participating in the Google Summer of Code, head on over to our [GSoC 2012](http://wiki.xmpp.org/web/Summer_of_Code_2012) Wiki page and find out what projects are looking for your help. The deadline for Students to apply is April 6th at 6pm UTC, so be sure to apply before then.
