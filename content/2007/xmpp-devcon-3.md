We've scheduled [XMPP DevCon3](http://wiki.jabber.org/index.php/DevCon) for July 23 and 24, 2007, in Portland, Oregon, USA. Logistical details are being worked out right now, but save the dates if you're interested in brainstorming real-time applications with other XMPP developers in an informal, technology-focused environment. Stay tuned for further updates in the near future.

**[vj](#20 "2007-05-09 09:01:50"):** I have a portland oregon guide online with a great deal of information about services around the Oregon Convention Center. If the DevCon won't be meeting there, let me know where and I can develop specialized resources for your attendees. And, if there's anything your attendees would be interested in, which isn't covered, I'd be glad to research that as well. Thanks.
