Late yesterday the RFC Editor [announced](http://www1.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/ietf-announce/current/msg03663.html) that the specification defining a URN namespace for use by the XMPP Standards Foundation has been published as [RFC 4854](http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4854.txt). See our [previous post](http://blog.xmpp.org/?p=13) for background information.
