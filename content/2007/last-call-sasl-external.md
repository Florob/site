Today we [issued](http://mail.jabber.org/pipermail/standards/2007-January/013676.html) a Last Call regarding [XEP-0178: Best Practices for Use of SASL EXTERNAL](http://www.xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0178.html). This specification is part of our [continuing effort](http://blog.xmpp.org/?p=4) to advance the XMPP RFCs to Draft Standard within the IETF. Although XEP-0178 does not contain any proposed changes to [RFC 3920](http://www.xmpp.org/rfcs/rfc3920.html) for inclusion in [rfc3920bis](http://www.xmpp.org/internet-drafts/draft-saintandre-rfc3920bis-01.html), it does document best practices regarding a particular [SASL](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4422.txt) authentication mechanism, in particular the SASL EXTERNAL mechanism as it relates to the X.509 public key infrastructure. We've gained quite a bit of experience with SASL EXTERNAL recently given our [launch](http://www.xmpp.org/xsf/press/2006-12-06.shtml) of an [intermediate certification authority](https://www.xmpp.net/) for the XMPP network, and XEP-0178 incorporates some lessons learned. The Last Call ends 2007-02-13, so if you see any problems with the spec send feedback to the [standards discussion list](http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/standards).
