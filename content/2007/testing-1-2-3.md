One of the [roadmap](http://www.xmpp.org/xsf/roadmap.shtml) items we discussed at the [XMPP Summit](http://blog.xmpp.org/?p=12) in late February was the need to certify that XMPP clients and servers comply with our protocol specifications. While eventually we would like to have a formal certification program, we recently have taken two steps toward that goal:

1. The [publication](http://mail.jabber.org/pipermail/standards/2007-April/015073.html) of basic and intermediate certification levels for clients and servers in [XEP-0211](http://www.xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0211.html), [XEP-0212](http://www.xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0212.html), and [XEP-0213](http://www.xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0213.html).
2. The launch of the [XMPP Interoperability Testing Network](http://www.xmpp.org/interop/), a private network of servers that XMPP developers can use for testing their code against a wide range of server and client implementations.

Both of these efforts should begin to yield results in the next few months, resulting in a better, more consistent experience for end users and server administrators alike.
