Because the XSF is a standards development organization, we strive to honor standards developed by other organizations. To that end, we recently updated the web pages at [www.xmpp.org](http://www.xmpp.org/) (including our [specification series](http://www.xmpp.org/extensions/)) to comply with [XHTML 1.0](http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/). If you find a page with an "xhtml 1.0 compliant" link at the bottom but the page does not [validate](http://validator.w3.org/), please report the error to webmaster at xmpp.org.
