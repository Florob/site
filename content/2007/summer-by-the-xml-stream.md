The [XMPP Standards Foundation](http://www.xmpp.org/) will once again be [participating](http://code.google.com/soc/xmpp/about.html) in the [Google Summer of Code](http://code.google.com/soc/) for 2007. What is a standards organization doing in the Summer of Code? Well, the Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) emerged from the Jabber open-source community and we still have many active open-source projects. Plus as [previously mentioned](http://blog.xmpp.org/?p=12) our community is a cohesive blend of open standards, commercial organizations, and open-source developers. Here at the XSF we usually focus on the open standards part of the equation, but we actively work to encourage the creation of open-source code, too. So check out out [project ideas](http://wiki.jabber.org/index.php/Summer_of_Code_2007) and [send in an application](http://groups.google.com/group/google-summer-of-code-announce/web/guide-to-the-gsoc-web-app-for-student-applicants)!

UPDATE: If you apply, ignore the mention of the application template -- you do not need to fill that out in order to apply!
