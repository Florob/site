There are many ways that you can participate in the work of the XMPP Standards Foundation.

**Become a Member**

Membership is individual (not corporate) and is based on technical merit (not financial contribution, since membership is free). New members apply for membership and typically are elected by the existing members if they are active participants in the XMPP developer community through authoring or commenting on XMPP protocols, implementing XMPP-based software, offering XMPP-based services, etc.

Applications from prospective new members are accepted during the first two weeks of every quarter (i.e., the first two weeks of January, April, July, and October). Click to [read more about membership](/participate/become-a-member/).

Participate in XMPP Discussions

There are many [active discussion venues](/participate/discuss-xmpp/), lists and forums for Jabber/XMPP developers, system administrators, and end users.

**Come to a Summit**

[XMPP Summits](/participate/the-xmpp-summit/) are usually held twice a year, colocated with FOSDEM (in Europe, February) and OSCON (in North America, July). The XMPP presentations, hackfests and development meetings attract increasingly large audiences each year, as does the XSF dinner.

If you visit FOSDEM or OSCON, be sure to drop by the XMPP booth to introduce yourself and buy a t-shirt!
