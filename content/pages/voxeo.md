[![Voxeo](http://www.voxeo.com/images/logo-top.gif)](http://www.voxeo.com)   Voxeo helps enterprises improve service and lower costs by automating and connecting their most common phone calls with our Interactive Voice Response (IVR) or Voice over IP (VoIP) solutions. Our hosting and premise platform solutions, and developer services - powered by VoiceXML and CCXML - are used by over 200,000 customers and developers to create and deploy any telephone application they desire. Voxeo was founded on the principle that extraordinary customer service is essential to success. Our corporate focus is to remain the most customer-oriented vendor in the telephony platform and services market. This unique focus has led to commercial success in a time when most telecom companies have suffered dramatic declines. Voxeo has invested over $50 million in infrastructure, technology, and programs to deliver versatile, standards-based platforms and hosting solutions for IVR and VoIP telephone applications.   Our business is cash-flow positive, profitable, and has grown over 100% per year since 1999. Voxeo has operations in the USA and Europe, delivering hosted and customer premise voice platforms world-wide from both locations. Voxeo's customers range from the Fortune 50 to 50 of the most innovative small businesses around.   We focus diligently on their success.   When surveyed, our customers give us extremely high marks for technical versatility and customer service excellence.   These are the primary reasons enterprises choose Voxeo. While we welcome the opportunity to work with any enterprise or channel partner, we prefer to continue our investment in the technical and service qualities our customers value most.   As a result, Voxeo does not serve long distance carriers, cellular providers, or other companies who are strictly focused on obtaining the lowest tier of pricing available in the IVR or VoIP platform markets.
