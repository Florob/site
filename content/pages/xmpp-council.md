The XMPP Council is the technical steering group that approves XMPP Extension Protocols. The Council is governed by the [XSF Bylaws](/about-xmpp/xsf/xsf-bylaws/) and [XEP-0001](/extensions/xep-0001.html), as augmented by various [policies and procedures](/about-xmpp/xsf/xmpp-council/policies-and-procedures/). The Council is elected by the members of the XMPP Standards Foundation each year in the autumn. In the interest of transparency, [chatroom logs](http://logs.xmpp.org/council/) and [mailing list archives](http://mail.jabber.org/pipermail/council/) are available (anyone can [subscribe to the mailing list](http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/council), but only Council members can post).
