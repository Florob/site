The base XMPP specifications are [RFC 6120](/rfcs/rfc6120.html), [RFC 6121](http://xmpp.org/rfcs/rfc6121.html), and [RFC 6122](http://xmpp.org/rfcs/rfc6122.html). Although most XMPP extensions are defined in the [XEP series](http://xmpp.org/xmpp-protocols/xmpp-extensions/) published by the XMPP Standards Foundation, several XMPP-related Internet-Drafts are currently under consideration within the [IETF](http://www.ietf.org/), as listed at the web page for the IETF's [XMPP Working Group](http://tools.ietf.org/wg/xmpp/).

Note: Over the years, a number of other XMPP-related Internet-Drafts have been published. Some of these are available on this site in the [attic](/internet-drafts/attic/), or use the [IETF datatracker](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/search/?name=xmpp&rfcs=on&activeDrafts=on&oldDrafts=on&search_submit=) to find documents of interest.
