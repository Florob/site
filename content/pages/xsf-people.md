[Jeremie Miller](http://twitter.com/jeremie) invented Jabber/XMPP technologies in 1998, released the original Jabber server ([jabberd](http://jabberd.org/)) in January 1999, led the technical direction of the Jabber/XMPP community through the release of jabberd 1.4 in February 2001, helped found the Jabber Software Foundation (now the XMPP Standards Foundation) in 2001, and contributed to formalization of the core Jabber protocols through participation of the IETF's XMPP WG in 2002-2004. Although Jeremie is no longer actively involved in the technical evolution of XMPP, he is generally recognized as "Benevolent Dictator for Life" within the Jabber/XMPP community. Jeremie was a member of the XSF Board of Directors and the XMPP Council for 2001-2003.
