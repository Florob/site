The XMPP Standards Foundation will hold its fifth "XMPP Summit" meeting on July 21 and 22, 2008, in Portland, Oregon, USA (the same week as [OSCON 2008](http://conferences.oreilly.com/oscon/)). Read on for details.

### Participants

Participation is open to all developers, service operators, and other interested individuals.

### Agenda

As posted by Peter Saint-Andre on the summit@xmpp.org list, 2008-07-16 (with further tweaking). This is a rough agenda. As always, agenda bashing is welcome. As much as possible, I'd like to keep the spirit of an [unconference](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconference). The summit hours will be something like this:

* Monday 9:30 AM to 4:30 PM
* Tuesday 9:30 AM to 2:30 PM
Typically people are burnt out after a day and a half, thus the shorter day on Tuesday. But feel free to hang around and hack or continue the discussions. Given that we have ~40 people, it will be difficult to have a productive conversation with only one track because some people will get bored with the current topic and such. Therefore I suggest we hold hold full-group sessions punctuated by breakouts of two or more concurrent threads (T1, T2, etc.). During the multi-threaded times, people can move back and forth as they please for discussion, hacking, interop testing, a change of pace, etc. We'll work out the final details in real time. :) For the full-group sessions we may use the [fishbowl](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fishbowl_\(conversation\)) approach. For several of the sessions, I've provided URLs for background reading. Lunch and beverages are included and will be served in the room.

#### Monday

##### 9:30 - 10:00

Introductions, logistics, agenda bashing

##### 10:00 - 11:00

T1: Interop testing setup + discussion about online testing T2: XMPP 101 + general Q&A to bring newbies up to speed

##### 11:00 - 12:00

[Lightning talks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning_Talk)! We have ~40 people. If 6 people present, that's 10 minutes each including Q&A. If 12 people present, that's 5 minutes each. And so on. Any volunteers to present? If not, I'll volunteer you at the summit! ;) I'm particularly interested in short talks about problem areas that we need to focus on during the rest of the summit (or afterwards).

##### 12:00 - 1:00

Semi-working lunch of sorts. Wander off, stick around, hack code, check email, post photos, blog about how much fun you're having, update your GTD app with action items, whatever.

##### 1:00 - 2:00

_Note: we will use these threads as partial input to the HTTP+XMPP "hybrid" discussion at 2:00._ T1: Microblogging [http://www.xmpp.org/extensions/inbox/microblogging.html](http://www.xmpp.org/extensions/inbox/microblogging.html) [http://blog.dave.cridland.net/?p=61](http://blog.dave.cridland.net/?p=61) [https://stpeter.im/?p=2224](https://stpeter.im/?p=2224) [http://openmicroblogging.org/](http://openmicroblogging.org/) T2: Server/component interactions [http://www.xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0114.html](http://www.xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0114.html) [http://www.xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0225.html](http://www.xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0225.html) how to implement protocols like pubsub, pep, and MUC as external components? how can components access information like rosters and presence? how to access or share component services in a federated manner? authorization of components or remote users

##### 2:00 - 3:00

Full-group session on hybrid technologies. No, that's not gas and electric, it's HTTP + XMPP. Sub-topics include:

* When to use HTTP, when to use XMPP?
* [OAuth](http://oauth.net/) (see [XEP-0235](http://www.xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0235.html))
* REST and XMPP (see [here ](http://en.oreilly.com/oscon2008/public/schedule/detail/4359), [here](http://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/rest_arch_style.htm), [here](http://arch.jabber.com/archives/2003/12/000062.html) and [here](https://stpeter.im/?p=1791))
* Shared rosters / [communities](http://www.xmpp.org/extensions/inbox/communities.html)

##### 3:00 - 4:00

T1: Jingle I (identify open issues for push to Draft)
