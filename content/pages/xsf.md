The XMPP Standards Foundation (formerly the Jabber Software Foundation) is an independent, nonprofit standards development organization whose primary mission is to define open protocols for presence, instant messaging, and real-time communication and collaboration on top of the IETF's Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP). The XSF also provides information and infrastructure to the worldwide community of Jabber/XMPP developers, service providers, and end users.

At the core of the XSF is its elected Membership who, in turn, elect a Council (the technical leadership) and Board (the business leadership). If you have an interest in XMPP, it is straightforward to [become a Member of the XSF](/participate/become-a-member/).

* [Extensions Editor](/about-xmpp/xsf/xsf-people/#extensions)

Although our elected members and self-selected sponsors provide a legal and financial basis for the organization, the XSF not a closed industry consortium but instead is a completely open and transparent standards development organization in which any interested individual may freely participate. Furthermore, our developer-friendly standards process avoids design by committee and places a premium on the values that built the Internet in the first place: rough consensus and running code. For further information about the XSF and the xmpp.org website, visit any of the following:
