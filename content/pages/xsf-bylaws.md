## ARTICLE I: Offices

**Section 1.1 Registered Office and Registered Agent**. The address of the initial registered office of The XMPP Standards Foundation (the "Corporation") in the State of Delaware and the name of the initial registered agent of the Corporation at such address are set forth in the Certificate of Incorporation (the "Certificate"). The Corporation may, from time to time, designate a different address as its registered office or a different person as its registered agent, or both; provided, however, that such designation shall become effective upon the filing of a statement of such change with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware as is required by law.

**Section 1.2 Principal Office**. The principal office of the Corporation shall be at 1899 Wynkoop Street, Denver, Colorado 80202, or at such other place as the Board of Directors shall designate from time to time. The business of the Corporation shall be transacted from the principal office, and the records of the Corporation shall be kept there.

**Section 1.3 Other Offices**. The Corporation shall have such offices either within or outside the State of Delaware and within or outside the United States, as the Board of Directors may from time to time determine or as the business of the Corporation may require. In the event the Corporation desires to qualify to do business in one or more states other than Delaware, the Corporation shall designate the location of the registered office in each such state and designate the registered agent for service of process at such address in the manner provided by the law of the state in which the corporation elects to be qualified.

## ARTICLE II: Members

**Section 2.1 Admission of Members**. The initial Members of the Corporation shall be admitted upon the affirmative vote of the Board of Directors of the Corporation at the initial meeting of the Board of Directors. Thereafter, to be eligible for membership, a person, corporation, organization, or other entity must complete a written membership application in such form as shall be adopted by the Board of Directors from time to time. The substance of such membership application must be included in a notice to the Members of the meeting at which such membership application is considered. Members shall be admitted upon the affirmative vote of a majority of the Members of the Corporation voting. Applications from prospective new and returning members shall be accepted on a rolling basis and shall be considered at quarterly meetings of the Members in January, April, July, and October. Emeritus Members may request reinstatement as Members of the Corporation by completing and submitting a membership application to the Board of Directors which shall be considered in the same manner as an application for a new membership. An applicant for membership may not be admitted if, at the time of application or consideration, fifteen percent (15%) of the Members of the Corporation are employed by or represent the same corporation or organization as that corporation or organization which employs the applicant or is represented by the applicant.

**Section 2.2 Members**. All Members of the Corporation shall have voting rights in accordance with Article III of these Bylaws. Dues, assessments and levies shall not be imposed on the Members of the Corporation as a condition of membership.

**Section 2.3 Emeritus Members**. An Emeritus Member is a former Member whose membership has been suspended and converted to emeritus status, either voluntarily or by action of the Members. An Emeritus Member is not considered a Member of the Corporation for purposes of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware. Members may voluntarily convert their membership to Emeritus status at any time upon ten (10) days' written, signed notice delivered to an officer of the Corporation. Upon an affirmative vote of two-thirds (2/3) of the Members of the Corporation, the membership of a Member shall be converted into an emeritus membership.

Upon the effective date of conversion of the membership of any Member to Emeritus status, all rights and obligations of such Member shall cease, including, but not limited to voting rights. Emeritus Members shall be entitled to attend (but not vote) at meetings of the Members, and the officers of the Corporation shall attempt, in good faith, to continue to deliver notices of meetings of the Members of the Corporation to such Emeritus Members. References in these Bylaws to a "Member" or to the "Members" of the Corporation shall not include any Emeritus Member unless explicitly provided otherwise. An Emeritus Member may apply for membership in the Corporation as set forth in Section 2.1 of these Bylaws.

**Section 2.4 Resignation**. Members and Emeritus Members may resign as such by tendering such written resignation to an officer of the Corporation.

**Section 2.5 Removal by Members**. A Member may be involuntarily removed from membership by an affirmative vote of two-thirds (2/3) of the Members of the Corporation.

**Section 2.6 Automatic Termination**. Members may have their membership status automatically terminated and their names removed by the Secretary of the Corporation from all membership records of the Corporation if they fail to participate in three (3) consecutive meetings of the Members of the Corporation, held electronically or otherwise.

**Section 2.7 Effect of Resignation, Removal or Automatic Termination**. All rights, including voting rights, if any, of a Member shall cease on the date of resignation, removal, or automatic termination of such Member. A former Member may reapply for membership in accordance with Section 2.1 of these Bylaws.

**Section 2.8 Affiliated Persons**. The Board of Directors may, from time to time, establish classes of persons affiliated with the Corporation other than Members of the Corporation as defined in this Article II. Such persons shall not be considered Members of the Corporation within the meaning of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, and shall have no vote on any matter before the Corporation. The Board may establish annual dues payable by persons associated or affiliated with the Corporation and such other rules pertaining to such persons as the Board may from time to time determine.

**Section 2.9 Terms of Membership.** Membership in the Corporation shall be valid for a period of one (1) year, measured from the date of the Members' meeting at which the member was admitted or last re-admitted. In order for an individual's membership not to lapse after 12 months, the member must (i) re-apply during the membership application period that begins 12 months after the application period during which the member last applied and (ii) be re-admitted in accordance with the procedures defined in Section 2.1. For the purposes of instituting this policy, members accepted in 2001 shall re-apply in July 2003 and members accepted in 2002 shall re-apply in October 2003; thereafter, members shall re-apply according to the 12-month rule (e.g., members accepted in January 2003 shall re-apply in January 2004).
