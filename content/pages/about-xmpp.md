The Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) is an open technology for real-time communication, which powers a wide range of applications including instant messaging, presence, multi-party chat, voice and video calls, collaboration, lightweight middleware, content syndication, and generalized routing of XML data. The [technology pages](/about-xmpp/technology-overview/ ) provide more information about the various XMPP "building blocks". Several [books](http://xmpp.org/resources/books/) about Jabber/XMPP technologies are available, as well.

The core technology behind XMPP was invented by [Jeremie Miller](/about-xmpp/xsf/xsf-people/#bdfl) in 1998, refined in the Jabber open-source community in 1999 and 2000, and formalized by the [IETF](http://www.ietf.org/) in 2002 and 2003, resulting in publication of the [XMPP RFCs](http://xmpp.org/rfcs/) in 2004 and updated RFCs in 2011 (see the [history page](http://xmpp.org/about-xmpp/history/) for more details).

Although the core technology is stable, the XMPP community continues to define various [XMPP extensions](/protocols/xmpp-extensions/ ) through an open standards process run by the XMPP Standards Foundation. There is also an active community of open-source and commercial developers, who produce a wide variety of XMPP-based software.

If you have any questions about the use or development of XMPP technologies, feel free to participate in one of the open [discussion venues](/participate/discuss-xmpp/ ) hosted by the XMPP Standards Foundation.
