[![Google](/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/sidebar-google.png)](http://www.google.com/intl/en/about/) Beginning in 1996, Stanford University graduate students Larry Page and Sergey Brin built a search engine called “BackRub” that used links to determine the importance of individual web pages. By 1998 they had formalized their work, creating the company we know today as Google. Since then, Google has grown by leaps and bounds. From offering search in a single language they now offer dozens of products and services—including various forms of advertising and web applications for all kinds of tasks—in scores of languages. And starting from two computer science students in a university dorm room, they now have thousands of employees and offices around the world. The XMPP Standards Foundation is a regular participent organization in [Google's Summer of Code (GSoC)](http://code.google.com/soc/), a global program that offers student developers stipends to write code for various open source software projects.
