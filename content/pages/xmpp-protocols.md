XMPP protocols are published in several forms:

* The core protocols are defined in [RFC 6120](/rfcs/rfc6120.html), [RFC 6121](http://xmpp.org/rfcs/rfc6121.html), and [RFC 6122](http://xmpp.org/rfcs/rfc6122.html) as published by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF).
* Several [related RFCs](/xmpp-protocols/rfcs/) have been published as well.
* Various individuals and IETF working groups are working on other XMPP technologies in the form of [Internet-Drafts](/xmpp-protocols/internet-drafts/).
* Finally, the XMPP Standards Foundation (XSF) publishes extensions to the core protocols in the form of [XMPP Extension Protocols](/xmpp-protocols/xmpp-extensions/) (XEPs).

A list of [protocol namespaces](/xmpp-protocols/protocol-namespaces/) is also available.
