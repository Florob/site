Here is how to submit a proposal to the XMPP Standards Foundation for consideration as an [XMPP Extension Protocol](/xmpp-protocols/xmpp-extensions/):

1. Contact the [XMPP Extensions Editor](/about-xmpp/xsf/xsf-people/#editor) so that he knows to expect your submission.
2. Write your proposal following the guidelines described in [XEP-0143: Guidelines for Authors of XMPP Extension Protocols](/extensions/xep-0143.html).
3. Make sure you read, understand, and agree to the XSF's [IPR Policy](/about-xmpp/xsf/xsf-ipr-policy/) before you submit your proposal!
4. Email the XML file (or a URL for the file) to the [XMPP Extensions Editor](/about-xmpp/xsf/xsf-people/#editor) with a subject line of 'ProtoXEP: [your title here]'.
Note: It is the author's responsibility to provide a properly-formatted source file (see the [template](/extensions/xep-template.xml) file maintained under [source control](http://xmpp.org/about-xmpp/xsf/xsf-source-control/)). Proposals submitted in HTML, TXT, MS Word, Open Document Format, etc. will be returned to the proposal author for proper formatting.
