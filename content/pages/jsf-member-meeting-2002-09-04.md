2. **Call for Quorum**

Per Section 3.8 of the JSF Bylaws, "one-third (1/3) of the Members entitled to vote, represented in person or proxy, including through remote communication, shall constitute a quorum at a meeting of Members." Since 50 Members are represented in proxy and an additional 3 Members are represented in person or via phone, quorum is met.

3. **Acceptability of agenda, call for new items**

No objections voiced, agenda is acceptable.

4. **Report on first year of operations**

* JSF formally founded on 2001-08-20 with over 100 founding members
* Board of Directors inactive (e.g., no quarterly meetings)
* Operations left to Chair (Andre Durand) and Executive Director (until 2001-10, Michael Bauer; from 2001-10, Peter Saint-Andre)
* Only slight progress made on fundraising, the Jabber trademark, management of the JabberPowered program, software certification, IPR policy, and other business concerns
* Progress more substantial on the Jabber protocol; JEP Editor and Jabber Council (technical advisory committee) quite active; 44 JEPs created, 6 informational JEPs advanced to Active, 3 standards-track JEPs advanced to Draft; protocol enhancement process modified and improved based on experience
