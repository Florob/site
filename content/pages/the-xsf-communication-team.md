The mission of the Communication Team is to continuously improve the editorial quality of written, spoken, and visual materials produced by the XMPP Standards Foundation (XSF). The Team achieves its mission through several core activities, which include but are not limited to:

* Editorial reviews of specifications in the XSF's XEP series
* Production of white papers, developer guides, HOWTOS, glossaries, slide presentations, tutorials, brochuers, and other information for use by those who develop, deploy, and use XMPP technologies
* Timely publication of informal reports about XMPP, such as postings at the XSF's weblog
* Maintenance of the xmpp.org website, including content, navigation, and "look and feel"
The Team is limited to elected members of the XSF (and invited others at the discretion of the team). Participants are recruited from among the XSF membership by the team lead and approved by a simple majority of the existing team members. The team has two meeting venues (the [commteam@muc.xmpp.org](xmpp:commteam@muc.xmpp.org?join) chatroom and the [commteam@xmpp.org](http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/commteam) email list) and uses a [wiki page](http://wiki.xmpp.org/web/CommTeam_targets) for coordination.
