In this section you'll find information about XMPP Server, Clients and Libraries.

* [XMPP Clients](/xmpp-software/clients/)

We are keen to keep these pages up to date so, if you know of something we've missed, then please contact us (need a link to a contact page). If you're involved in an XMPP project that we've missed, then please tell us more about your project so we can add you to the relevant list and include news from your project in our regular Roundup blog posts.
