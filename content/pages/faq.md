### What is the relationship between XMPP and Jabber?

It's complicated. :)

However, in essence, XMPP is the name for the streaming XML protocol that emerged from the Jabber open-source community in 1999. When that community submitted the protocol to the [IETF](http://www.ietf.org/) in 2002, it chose to use the name "XMPP" instead of "Jabber" to eliminate the possibility of confusion with the open-source community and the commercial Jabber.com company (since acquired by Cisco Systems, Inc.). See the [history page](/about-xmpp/history/) for more details.

### Can I use the XMPP logo?

The XMPP logo is licensed under the same terms as the rest of the content on this website, namely a [slightly modified MIT license](/about-xmpp/xsf/xsf-ipr-policy/#legal). You can find the logo in several formats: [PNG](/images/xmpp.png), [SVG](/images/xmpp.svg), and [AI](/images/xmpp.ai).
