The XMPP Standards Foundation is a voluntary organization the does not charge for membership. We're able to maintain our 'no charge' policy, and thereby keep barriers to membership to a minimum, due to the financial and 'in kind' donations we receive from our sponsors. So please visit the sponsor pages linked below (and the sponsor sites) to say "thank you".

### Interested in Sponsorship opportunities?

Sponsorship can be yearly or event-based (such as sponsoring the XSF Dinner or an XSF event at OSCON). Sponsors benefits include:

* Being featured on this website.
* Promotion at XMPP Summits and other events.
* Submission of relevant articles for posting on the XMPP blog.

If you're interested in sponsoring the XSF, [please see this page for more information](/sponsor/sponsor-the-xsf/).


### Financial Contributions

Financial contributions are accepted (mostly from XSF Sponsors) either by check to our [mailing address](/participate/contact-us/) or by PayPal to <paypal@xmpp.org>. Because the XMPP Standards Foundation is [recognized](/xsf/docs/XSF-Tax-Exempt-Ruling-2007.pdf) as a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization, your contribution might be tax deductible.
