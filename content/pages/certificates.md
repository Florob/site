Thank you for your interest in XMPP security!

In the past, the XMPP Intermediate Certification Authority offered free certificates to administrators of XMPP servers. That service, offered at [xmpp.net](http://xmpp.net/) jointly with [StartCom](http://www.startcom.org/) for several years, [ceased operations](/2009/09/ca-updates/) in late 2009. However, you can still obtain free XMPP certificates directly from StartCom by visitingÂ [http://www.startssl.com/](http://www.startssl.com/).

Naturally, server administrators can obtain certificates from other certification authorities as well.

If you have any questions about the XMPP ICA or certificates in general, please post to the operators@xmpp.org list (visit [http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/operators](http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/operators) to subscribe).
