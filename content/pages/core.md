### 1. Overview

At its core, XMPP is a technology for streaming XML over a network. The protocol, which emerged from the Jabber open-source community in 1999, was originally designed to provide an open, secure, decentralized alternative to consumer-oriented instant messaging (IM) services like ICQ, AIM, and MSN. The core technologies were formalized under the name Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) at the [IETF](http://www.ietf.org/) in 2004. These core technologies include:

* The base XML streaming layer
* Channel encryption using Transport Layer Security (TLS)
* Strong authentication using the Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL)
* Use of UTF-8 for complete Unicode support, including fully internationalized addresses
* Built-in information about network availability ("presence")
* Presence subscriptions for two-way authorization
* Presence-enabled contact lists ("rosters")

### 2. Specifications

The core XMPP technologies are defined in two RFCs published by the IETF:

* [RFC 3920: XMPP Core](/rfcs/rfc3920.html)
* [RFC 3921: XMPP IM](/rfcs/rfc3921.html)
These RFCs are currently undergoing revision based on implementation and deployment experience since 2004. The revised versions are available at <[http://xmpp.org/protocols/internet-drafts/](/internet-drafts/)>.

### 3. Implementations

There are many implementations of the core XMPP specifications. See the following pages for details:

* [Clients](/xmpp-software/clients/)
* [Servers](/xmpp-software/servers/)
* [Code Libraries](/xmpp-software/libraries/)

### 4. Discussion Venues

The XMPP Standards Foundation maintains [several email discussion lists](/participate/discuss-xmpp/) about the core XMPP technologies. The primary list is the "standards@xmpp.org" list. As with all XSF technology lists, the standards@xmpp.org list is open to all interested individuals.
