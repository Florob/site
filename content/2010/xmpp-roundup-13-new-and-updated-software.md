Welcome to the XMPP software Roundup 13. As announced in the [latest Roundup](http://blog.xmpp.org/index.php/2010/01/xmpp-roundup-13-articles-talks-and-events/), we have split it into different parts. The first part covered articles, talks and events. This post covers new and updated software, the next one will cover XMPP services. Special thanks to Will, Waqas, Jack, Guillaume, Nicolas, who have actively contributed to this report. Due to the high number of new items (yes, the XMPP community is super-active), we have sectionned these into the classical division clients, servers, and libraries, and... a last section you should check carefully. ** Clients** _Jabbim for Android_ The Jabbim team has released an early version of [Jabbim for Android](http://www.jabbim.com/android/), the Linux-based OS platform for mobile phones and devices from Google. _joom_ Released under the Artistic and GPL licenses, [joom](http://code.google.com/p/joom/) is a collaborative brainstorming tool, similar to a group chat plus topics creation. First originality, the UI combines the personal roster, as well as the room roster. The other originality, is that the UI shows different views of the conversations: the regular stream of messages, and the active and inactive topic views, which filter out messages with certain hashtags. Thus it is possible to hold mulitple conversations in one room. _Gajim 0.13_ Yann Le Boulanger, aka Asterix, has announced the [release 0.13 of the Gajim XMPP client](http://www.gajim.org/), bringing BOSH, roster versionning, XHTML-IM sending, and many bug fixes. _Coccinella 0.96.16 Released_ Sander Devrieze has [announced Coccinella 0.96.16](http://coccinella.im/coccinella-0.96.16), bringing a lot of bug fixes, as well as a tenth birthday. _Psi 0.14 is out_ This time we've made sure Psi is not missed in the Roundup: Justin Karneges has [announced the version 0.14 of the Psi XMPP client](http://lists.affinix.com/pipermail/psi-devel-affinix.com/2009-December/008928.html). It brings color options to the chat window, reason for kick/ban in groupchat, improved User Info window, support for Enchant as an alternative to Aspell, commandline interface now supports choosing profile and setting status, D-BUS interface now supports setting status and indicating sleep/wake, fixed voice calling compatibility bugs with Pidgin and Empathy, and of course various other minor improvements and bugfixes. _Haskell: XMPP and matsuri_ [matsuri](http://kagami.touhou.ru/projects/show/matsuri) is a ncurses XMPP client written on Haskell, published under the GPLv3 license by Kagami. _Yaxim_ [Yaxim](http://github.com/pfleidi/yaxim) is new XMPP client for the Android platform. _Juick for Android_ Juick, the real-time blogging and social network platform based on XMPP, has a [specific client](http://code.google.com/p/juick-android/) on the Android platform. _Vacuum-IM_ [Vacuum-IM](http://code.google.com/p/vacuum-im/) is a new multi-account, multi-platform XMPP client. It uses the Qt library, and is released under the GPLv3 license, as a version number 1.0. **Servers** _Openfire under the Apache license_ The Openfire server is undergoing [a change of license](http://www.igniterealtime.org/community/message/196063), from the GPL to the Apache 2.0 license. The next version with the updated license will be released in the near future. _Legacy IM Connections via M-Link_ Isode has [announced](http://isode.com/company/wordpress/?p=6) that they are partnering with Zion Software to deploy the [JBuddy XMPP Gateway](http://www.zionsoftware.com/products/xmpp-gateway/) for connectivity between Isode's M-Link server software and legacy IM networks. _Tigase Server 4.3_ Artur Hefczyc has released [version 4.3 of the Tigase Server](http://www.tigase.org/en/content/tigase-xmpp-server-431-b1858). It contains a lot of performance improvements, as well as new features, like monitoring, scripting, or roster versionning, and much more. _Spectrum_ [Spectrum](http://spectrum.im/) is an XMPP gateway, released under the GPL license, using the libpurple and gloox libraries, coming from a Google Summer of Code project. It supports ICQ, XMPP (Jabber, GTalk), AIM, MSN, Facebook, Twitter, Gadu-Gadu, IRC and SIMPLE. _python-xmpp-server_ [python-xmpp-server](http://github.com/thisismedium/python-xmpp-server) speaks for itself, it has been developed by [Medium](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medium_%28company%29). _Clustering plugin for Openfire is now open source_ [Ignite Realtime](http://www.igniterealtime.org/) has [announced](http://www.igniterealtime.org/community/blogs/ignite/2009/11/10/clustering-plugin-for-openfire-is-now-open-source) the release of the [clustering plugin](http://www.igniterealtime.org/projects/openfire/plugins/clustering/readme.html) for Openfire as opensource, under the Apache 2.0 license. _Prosody 0.6 and 1 year old_ Prosody, which is [one year old](http://blog.prosody.im/one-year-ago-today/), has been [published in version 0.6](http://blog.prosody.im/prosody-0-6-0-released/), bringing a telnet console, multi-sessions in MUC, stream compression, S2S encryption, per-host certificates, an importer for ejabberd MySQL dumps, and compatibility with ejabberd's vcard behaviour. **Libraries** _Strophe.js 1.0_
