The deadline for Student Proposals has come and gone and the XSF has received quite a few proposals covering a wide range of topics, clients and servers! The initial process of determining who is available for mentoring and what number of project slots we will be requesting has started with Google making a first pass Monday evening.Â  We should have information early in the process to start poking Mentors to start reviewing the proposals to prepare for the selection process. Nice work everyone!
