The [XMPP Standards Foundation](/xsf/) is currently accepting applications for new members. This application period will run until the end of January. Why apply?

* Help the XSF with technical reviews and communication efforts
* Help elect the [XMPP Council](/council/) and [XSF Board of Directors](http://xmpp.org/xsf/board/), or run for the Council yourself (council candidates must be XSF members)
* Help the XSF stay true to its mission of building an open, secure, feature-rich, decentralized infrastructure for real-time communication and collaboration over the Internet
Application instructions are available at [http://wiki.xmpp.org/web/Membership_Applications_January_2010](http://wiki.xmpp.org/web/Membership_Applications_January_2010) The application period ends on January 31, so take action today. :)
