As the XMPP Roundup posts are growing longer each time we send one out, we've decided to split them into smaller posts, each covering a different aspect of XMPP news:

* Articles, talks and events
* Software
* Services
* Specifications
So, here is the first of the "Articles, talks and events" posts. _XMPP Roundup translations_ The previous XMPP Roundup 12 has been translated into [spanish](http://www.jabberes.org/node/1139) thanks to naw and [french](http://news.jabberfr.org/?p=31) thanks to Misc and Nÿco. If you can translate the Roundups into other languages, please do so. _GAEJ + XMPP and rolling your own Agent_ Romin Irani, also author of the bloodbanklocator covered on the XMPP Roundup, has written an article on how to write an XMPP agent for GAEJ (Goole App Engine Java): "[Episode 2 : GAEJ + XMPP and rolling your own Agent](http://gaejexperiments.wordpress.com/2009/09/25/gaej-xmpp-and-rolling-your-own-agent/)" and "[Episode 2 : Update : Communicating to another XMPP Account via your Bot](http://gaejexperiments.wordpress.com/2009/10/09/episode-2-update-communicating-to-another-xmpp-account-via-your-bot/)". This is the second article in a series of four, the others are  more generally focused on GAEJ, and not specific to XMPP. _Realtime Blogging with IM and WordPress.com_ "[Realtime Blogging with IM and WordPress.com](http://wordpress.tv/2009/10/09/realtime-blogging-with-im/)" is a video showing how to be notified in real-time of new blog posts and comments using the XMPP service that already has been covered on the XMPP Roundup. _XMPP and SIMPLE: A Comparative Study_ Vinay has written [an article comparing XMPP and SIMPLE](http://vinaytechs.blogspot.com/2009/10/xmpp-and-simple-comparative-study.html), introducing both, describing their architectures, and of courses their strengths and weaknesses. _Really Real Time view to Twitter_ Jebu Ittiachen has posted a screencast showing [really real-time Twitter views](http://blog.jebu.net/2009/10/really-real-time-view-to-twitter/). He used ejabberd, Strophe, and erlang, in order to get the Twitter stream and distribute it over XMPP and BOSH. _The Google Wave buzz_ Google Wave, the new real-time communication tool, has seen a lot of buzz on the internet these days, here a quick collection of links:
