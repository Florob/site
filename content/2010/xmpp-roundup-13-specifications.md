Welcome to the Specification part of the XMPP Roundup #13, your irregular news from the XMPP community. It has been a long time since we have reported on specifications changes. Here is a short summary of what happened since September. This edition has been brought to you by Johann, Kevin, Will, Guillaume, Peter, and Nicolas. **Publishing Tools** XSF member [Tobias Markmann](http://ayena.de) has been doing great work on our publishing tools. In addition to improving the [primary XEP page](/extensions/) by enabling you to filter based on XEP type and status, he has developed a way for us to generate our specs in PDF format, with syntax highlighting for example stanzas. You can now download each one of them, read them while offline, and distribute them to your customers, partners, and best friends. You can also get the full pack as a tarball: [xepbundle.tar.bz2](http://xmpp.org/extensions/xepbundle.tar.bz2). [Tobias](http://ayena.de) and Waqas Hussain have also been working on a [tool to compare XEP versions](http://xmpp.org/extensions/diff) that recently went live. Thank you very much Tobias and Waqas! **Technical Review Team at work: Multi-User Chat** The newly-created [Technical Review Team](http://xmpp.org/xsf/teams/techreview/) is currently working to complete a thorough review of the venerable [XEP-0045: Multi-User Chat](http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0045.html). The team is also taking on more responsibility for maintenance of existing specs and publishing of new ones. We'll have a full report on those efforts in the near future. **XEP Submissions** Because use of XMPP continues to grow, the XSF receives new XEP proposals on a regular basis. The latest submissions are:

* [Jingle Relay Nodes](/extensions/inbox/jingle-nodes.html)
* [Server IP Check](/extensions/inbox/sic.html)
**New XEPs** These are the new XEPs have been accepted as 'Experimental' by the [XMPP Council](/council/):

* [XEP-0275: Entity Reputation](/extensions/xep-0275.html)

* [XEP-0277: Microblogging over XMPP](/extensions/xep-0277.html)
**Last Call** As XEPs move through the XSF's standards process, they are proposed for advance from 'Experimental' to 'Draft' (or 'Active' for informational specs). The following XEPs are in last call before moving ahead:

* [XEP-0226: Message Stanza Profiles](/extensions/xep-0226.html)
* [XEP-0227: Portable Import/Export Format for XMPP-IM Servers](/extensions/xep-0227.html)
