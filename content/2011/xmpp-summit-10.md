The tenth [XMPP Summit](/participate/the-xmpp-summit/) to be held by the XMPP Standards Foundation will happen on February 4-7, 2011, in Brussels, Belgium (the same weekend as [FOSDEM 2011](http://www.fosdem.org/)). See the [XMPP Summit wiki page](http://xmpp.org/participate/the-xmpp-summit/) for a detailed breakdown of the schedule and also to register/sign up for any of the events. We expect to have a very busy schedule with a Hackday, Interop and an XSF Dinner being just a few of the planned events. Slots are still open for people to speak and Sponsors are still needed for the XSF Dinner.
