Today I will be applying to the Google's [Summer of Code 2011](http://code.google.com/soc/) on behalf of the [XSF](/) - woo! The one thing that always makes it easy for Google to pick an organization is a large list of projects and students interested in our projects. So, if you're an XMPP project and would like to participate in GSoC under the XSF's umbrella, please visit the [Summer of Code 2011](http://wiki.xmpp.org/web/Summer_of_Code_2011) wiki page and start adding ideas of projects you would like to mentor. If you're a user of XMPP projects, and have great ideas, please get in contact with the projects and get them excited and involved in the process too. Your GSoC Org Admin, bear (at) xmpp (dot) org
