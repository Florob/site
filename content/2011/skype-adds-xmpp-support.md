Skype has [added support for XMPP](http://skypejournal.com/blog/2011/06/28/new-skype-beta-uses-im-interop-code/) to its latest Windows beta, according to Phil Wolff of Skype Journal. Janko Roettgers provides [further analysis](http://gigaom.com/2011/06/28/skype-xmpp-support/) at GigaOM. This is yet another demonstration of the power of open standards.
