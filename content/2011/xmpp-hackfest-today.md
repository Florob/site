The first day of the tenth [XMPP Summit](/participate/the-xmpp-summit/) to be held by the XMPP Standards Foundation is starting! The first event is the Hackfest where the XMPP devs and geeks will swarm the gracious Cisco meeting rooms. Please do visit the [XMPP Summit wiki page](http://xmpp.org/participate/the-xmpp-summit/) for a detailed breakdown of the schedule as space may be tight today.
