Since July 2006, the XMPP Standards Foundation has held a biannual get-together for developers, service operators, and other technical folks who are actively working on XMPP. We're happy to announce that the XSF will continue the tradition by holding its fifth [XMPP Summit](http://www.xmpp.org/summit/summit5.shtml) on July 21 and 22, 2008, in Portland, Oregon, USA. Thanks to generous assistance from [O'Reilly Conferences](http://conferences.oreilly.com/), the Summit will take place the same week and in the same location as [OSCON 2008](http://conferences.oreilly.com/oscon/).

Participation is open (and free!) to all developers, service operators, and other interested individuals. Please note that this is a hard-code technical get-together with plenty of coding sprints, hackfests, interop testing, brainstorming sessions, geeky lightning talks, etc. This meeting is not intended for marketing presentations and other fluff!

If you would like to participate, please join the [summit@xmpp.org](http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/summit) mailing list and introduce yourself.

See you in Portland!
