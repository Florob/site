Among other things, the XSF runs the jabber.org IM service, which is one of the largest nodes on the open XMPP network (yes, we really do believe in running code!). However, we've never had a privacy and security policy for this service. Recently we've been working to define such a policy so that folks who use the service know exactly where they stand. A draft of the policy is located at [http://xmpp.org/xsf/privacy.shtml](/xsf/privacy.shtml) and your feedback is welcome. Before the end of the year, the [XSF Board of Directors](http://xmpp.org/xsf/board/) will vote to approve the policy, but we are seeking input well before then so that all concerns are addressed. To send us your thoughts, feel free to comment here or to use the contact methods specified in the policy. Thanks!
