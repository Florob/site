The [XMPP Standards Foundation](http://www.xmpp.org/) is happy to finally recognize [United States Secure Hosting Center](http://usshc.com) as an in-kind [sponsor](http://www.xmpp.org/xsf/sponsors/usshc.shtml) of the XSF. USSHC has been hosting the XSF's server infrastructure (and before that the jabber.org project's machines) for as long as anyone can remember, and has unfailingly provided not only a secure location for our infrastructure but also extremely reliable service. After many years of laboring in obscurity, USSHC is finally receiving due recognition for its efforts. We look forward to continuing our relationship with USSHC for many years to come!
