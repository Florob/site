# About the Extended Conversation

This is the official weblog of the [XMPP Standards Foundation](http://www.xmpp.org/xsf/) (XSF). Here we post information about XMPP-related standards work within the [IETF](http://www.ietf.org/), notices about [XMPP extensions](http://www.xmpp.org/extensions/) that have been published or advanced within the XSF, updates about XSF initiatives such as the [intermediate certification authority](https://www.xmpp.net/), and more.
