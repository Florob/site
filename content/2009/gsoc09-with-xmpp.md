The XMPP Standards Foundation has helped support a number of open-source projects through Google's Summer of Code program over the years. Although the XSF is [not participating](http://blog.xmpp.org/index.php/2009/02/google-summer-of-code/) in the [Google Summer of Code](http://code.google.com/soc/) this year, a number of XMPP-related projects have been accepted by other mentoring organizations... On the [JabberFr forums](http://forum.jabberfr.org/), "Misc" [posted the full list](http://forum.jabberfr.org/viewtopic.php?pid=7958):

* Pidgin:
* [XMPP - libpurple transport](http://socghop.appspot.com/student_project/show/google/gsoc2009/pidgin/t124023373321), allowing servers to offer gateways to all the IM networks that Pidgin (or Adium) supports
* [Privacy Rewrite](http://socghop.appspot.com/student_project/show/google/gsoc2009/pidgin/t124023373129), giving users powerful controls over "XMPP firewalling"
* [Telepathy prpl](http://socghop.appspot.com/student_project/show/google/gsoc2009/pidgin/t124024196001), integrating Pidgin's powerful Purple library with the GNOME Instant Messaging and Presence framework
* Apache Foundation:
* [Extend the Vysper XMPP Server/Client with the publish-subscribe XEP (XEP-060)](http://socghop.appspot.com/student_project/show/google/gsoc2009/asf/t124021715212)
* Python Foundation:
* [Gajim: Whiteboard Implementation](http://socghop.appspot.com/student_project/show/google/gsoc2009/python/t124024629306)
* [Adding support for server-side history and roster versioning in Gajim](http://socghop.appspot.com/student_project/show/google/gsoc2009/python/t124024627730)
* Gnome :
* [GNOME-Games + Telepathy: Play GNOME-Sudoku with your IM contacts](http://socghop.appspot.com/student_project/show/google/gsoc2009/gnome/t124022403181)
* [Implement Music Sharing in Banshee using the Telepathy API](http://socghop.appspot.com/student_project/show/google/gsoc2009/gnome/t124022403765)
* KDE :
* [VoIP client for KDE (revive KCall)](http://socghop.appspot.com/student_project/show/google/gsoc2009/kde/t124022560138)
* [KDE - Conversation Logging Framework](http://socghop.appspot.com/student_project/show/google/gsoc2009/kde/t124022561796)
* [Turn Kopete chat window into a library](http://socghop.appspot.com/student_project/show/google/gsoc2009/kde/t124022561339)
* Maemo :
* [IM Client For Canola Using Python-purple](http://socghop.appspot.com/student_project/show/google/gsoc2009/maemo/t124022673888)
At the XSF, we're tremendously excited to see so much implementation of cutting edge technologies in so many widespread projects. It's a testement to the innovative nature of the XMPP community, and we're looking forward to seeing - and using - the results. _Article by Misc, translated by Nicolas Vérité, edited by Dave Cridland._

## Comments

**[Adam Nemeth](#27 "2009-04-29 13:56:14"):** The libpurple gateway is a long-awaited addition to our toolset. It seems that at least three projects try to gain from the fact that pidgin, as the most popular multi-protocol IM client has the best support for different protocols. Maybe we should think about it more deeply, as the consequence of these symptoms may be larger than we think now.
