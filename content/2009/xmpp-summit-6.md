Our apologies for the late notice, but the XSF will hold its [sixth XMPP Summit](/summit/summit6.shtml) in Brussels the same weekend as [FOSDEM 2009](http://fosdem.org/2009/). The basic schedule is as follows:

* Friday, February 6: [Jingle](/tech/jingle.shtml) hackfest for developers who are working on voice and video applications
* Saturday, February 7: XMPP devroom at FOSDEM featuring tutorials, presentations, demos, and lightning talks
* Sunday, February 8: A "free day" at FOSDEM to attend non-XMPP sessions
* Monday, February 9: The XMPP Summit itself, with in-depth technical discussions for active technical contributors to the XMPP community

For all the details, visit [http://xmpp.org/summit/summit6.shtml](/summit/summit6.shtml) and join the [summit@xmpp.org](http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/summit) discussion list.

See you in Brussels!
