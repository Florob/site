<!--A few photos from Day 1 of FOSDEM-->


A quick report from day 1 of FOSDEM. The Dev room was packed for virtually every session (standing room only as you can see from a selection of pictures below) and every talk, despite problems with the FOSDEM wi-fi, was well received. We'll hopefully post short summaries of the talks at a later date once the speakers have recovered from their hangovers and/or stopped eating bacon.   [caption id="attachment_250" align="aligncenter" width="422" caption=""A Fast-Paced Introduction to XMPP" - Remko Tronçon, Peter Saint-Andre"]!["A Fast-Paced Introduction to XMPP" - Remko Tronçon, Peter Saint-Andre](http://stage.xmpp.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/11.jpg)[/caption]   [caption id="attachment_251" align="aligncenter" width="422" caption=""PubSub and the Web" - Nathan Fritz"]!["PubSub and the Web" - Nathan Fritz](http://stage.xmpp.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/2.jpg)[/caption]   [caption id="attachment_252" align="aligncenter" width="422" caption=""Geolocation" - Simon Tennant"]!["Geolocation" - Simon Tennant](http://stage.xmpp.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/3.jpg)[/caption]
