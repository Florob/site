XMPP isn't just about instant messaging - in his talk at FOSDEM, Dirk Meyer explored how XMPP can form the basis of a powerful, yet secure, Personal Media Network - allowing access to your music collection from wherever you are, playing your videos on your friend's TV, and seemlessly integrating your personal collection with global media.  [Dirk's Presentation is available in PDF format here](http://stage.xmpp.org/?attachment_id=349).   [caption id="attachment_346" align="aligncenter" width="422" caption="Dirk Meyer @ FOSDEM 2009"][![Dirk Meyer @ FOSDEM 2009](http://stage.xmpp.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/dirk.jpg)](http://stage.xmpp.org/?attachment_id=346)[/caption]
