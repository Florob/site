Alex has started the membership voting process (big shout-out and thanks to Lance for getting the bot updated!) and would love it if all the current members chat with the memberbot and vote on the 2013 Q1 membership applications.

Proxy voting will continue until the close of business on May 1st with the meeting to follow on May 2nd.
